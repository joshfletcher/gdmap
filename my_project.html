<h4>Notable People related to the Information Age<h4>

<p>Charles Babbage, (1791–1871) is greatly known as “the father of computing” with his invention of the Difference Engine No.1 and others, which were the first successful automatic calculators.  For the time, his inventions were amazingly precise feats of engineering. Babbage was a polymath with expertise in mathematics, philosophy and astronomy, along with a keen interest in code breaking. Like many other inventers to follow Babbage, such as Tomas Edison and Alan Turing, the government did not support the construction of many of his inventions. (*Did You Know? – Thomas Edison (1847-1931) had the idea of putting small multi coloured light bulbs next to each other to create an image similar to what we find in computers today. Unfortunately, this project was never funded or developed.)

Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) is often referred to as the “prophet of the computer age”.  Though the daughter of famous poet, Lord Byron, she never met her father but was raised by her mother and tutored in mathematics and music. At seventeen, she met Charles Babbage and was very interested in his work. Ada thought that Babbage’s machine could perform many different tasks including creating music, calculating math problems and forming hypotheses. Charles Babbage thought that she was one of the most knowledgeable people regarding his inventions and theories. He asked her to translate a paper about his work. While translating the paper, she corrected a few mistakes, designed the first algorithm for the machine, and prophesized later uses for Babbage’s inventions, including artificial intelligence. She is considered the first computer programmer because her work created a way of using punch cards to calculate Bernoulli numbers. Her work was very important because it paved the way for Alan Turing who later read her work and went on to create his theories for the modern day computer in the 1940’s. (


Charles Babbage & Ada Lovelace  (19th century partnership):
Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were the Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak of their time. Like Steve Jobs, Ada Lovelace modified and greatly improved the work of Charles Babbage because of her tremendous intelligence and ability to see the broader opportunities of his inventions.  Where the road for Charles’s theories and inventions ended marked the beginning of the theories and ideas of Ada Lovelace. Like Steve Jobs, Ada was always pushing the limits of the current technology and ideas of her time regarding calculations, punch cards and computing. 









Alan Turing, (1912-1954) is described by cosmologist, Stephen Hawking, as "one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the modern era". Additionally, Turing was also a great logician, cryptanalyst, computer scientist and philosopher. He is especially well known for his work in World War II creating a machine called COLUSSUS that cracked the German codes encoded by the German machine, ‘enigma’. The use of Alan Turing’s COLOSSUS machine at Bletchley Park, the secret British government facility for code cracking, was one of the first steps toward the digital computer. It was reading Ada Lovelace’s ideas that illuminated the way for Turing’s ideas about artificial intelligence.  Before the war started, Turing made a theoretical design for a machine called the universal Turing machine. The universal Turing machine is a device that can calculate any mathematical problem, using a binary code consisting of 1s and 0s. This machine is very much like the modern day computer.  
("His brilliance was put into practice at Bletchley Park during the Second World War where he was pivotal to breaking the 'Enigma' code, helping to end the war and save thousands of lives,")
Steve Job (1955-2011) with the help of Steve Wozniak or “Woz” (1950-  ) combined form and function to create some of the world’s greatest technologies since the invention of the light bulb by Thomas J. Edison (1847-1931). Steve Jobs and Thomas Edison are much alike as they affected many millions of people over a vast range of medias and industries including, music, telecommunication, motion pictures and the electric motor industry. In many ways they were very much alike as they were both aggressive with self-promotion and the marketing and selling of their own and other people’s ideas and inventions. Both men were seen as having difficult personalities and unwieldy tempers. 
Like Edison, Steve’s inventions were so innovative and “cool” that people would line up for hours to purchase a new product. Steve Jobs had a life philosophy that he believed helped him to change the world. He is quoted as saying “everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you”. Steve Jobs was trying to say that everyone and anyone can create and innovate new ideas; the only difference is that different people have different opportunities. In Steve’s case, he grew up in Silicon Valley where he and his friends could, after school, get engineering instruction from other parents in the neighbourhood. As teens, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were inseparable as friends and future business partners. The first thing they built and marketed was an electronics kit that mimicked telephone router codes to make free calls around the world. Soon after, they would develop the first Apple computer. When it was released in 1970, Steve Job was just twenty-one years old not unlike Thomas Edison who was only twenty-two years old when he purchased his first patent. 
Today, I live in Ottawa, which used to be considered the Silicon Valley of the north. Like Steve jobs and Steve Wozniak, I have neighbours who are willing to teach me about programming and engineering with electronics. One day, I hope to create a life changing invention for the world like those of Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Thomas Edison. (box: April Fools day info)
