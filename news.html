<h4>The yes men have ben caut !
<h5>Social activism using social media
The movie Yes Men characterises the activism of two young men living in the United States who create false web sites to pose as high-ranking executives from companies and large government agencies that are not promoting public health and safety. One example of their actions was when they posed as spokespeople from DOW chemicals on the BBC news authorising twelve billion in compensation to the victims of the Bhopal gas leak in India. They went to India to see how the people who experienced one of the biggest industrial disasters felt about their hoax. The victims of the disaster were happy because the hoax brought new light to their story. The Yes Men are great examples of how social media and web sites can be used as powerful tools to create change in the world.</h5>
